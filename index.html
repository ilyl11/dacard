			<p>Another year, another blessing to cherish. I made this to let you know how much you mean to me.</p>
			<p>Life will always bring challenges, but I know you have the strength and heart to rise above every single one of them.</p>
			<p>Keep chasing your dreams and believing in yourself because you are capable of so much more than you realize. And whenever you need someone to cheer you on, listen, or simply stand by your side, know that you can count on me.</p>
			<p>Again, happiest birthday "kuya" Johndel hehe, take care of yourself; don't forget to take a rest and pray always. God bless!</p>
			<p>Psalm 20:4 (NIV) “May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.”</p>
